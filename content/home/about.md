# About Me

Hi, I am Alina Shrestha. I have completed my Bachelor in Computer Science and Information Technology from Patan Multiple Campus.
I have been working as Software Developer at Insight Workshop for a year and half now.

I believe technology is an essential part of human being. Knowledge of technology should be accessible to everyone in this world.
